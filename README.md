# React-template

This react template provides you with the basic tool set for developing a *react* app, using *redux* as your single source of truth.

Besides a helpful folder structure, it also provides a strict linter that you can run with `yarn lint` in order to keep your project's code always clean.

It uses *webpack-dev-server* and includes *webpack* configurations for development (*hot-reload*, *hot-module-replacement*).

Setup & Start
---
- Run `yarn`

- Use `yarn start:dev` to start the server

- Use `yarn lint` to run eslint over the project

Pending
---
- Production webpack configurations
- Production build script at `package.json`
